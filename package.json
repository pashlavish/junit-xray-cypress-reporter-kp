  "description": "range-jira-result is a custom reporter for use with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [XRay](https://www.getxray.app/) (Native Test Management for Jira) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) testing frameworks.   The reporter helps you to integrate your Cypress/Mocha test with XRay easily by producing enriched JUnit-style XML test report files which can be uploaded into XRay with API or other tools.   The reporter is built on the top of [mocha-junit-reporter v2.2.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha-junit-reporter) so all the configurations in the official doc, are inherited from this npm package.   This reporter offers the ability to specify a Jira-Issue for each it{} inside your cypress test and creates a custom report that is easy to load into XRay.",
